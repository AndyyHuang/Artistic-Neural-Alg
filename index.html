    <h1>Final Project: A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</h1>
    <p>In this project, I implemented "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Leon A. Gatys et al. and explored different hyper parameter configurations and methods.</p>

            <h2> Implementation Details</h2>
            <p>In my implementation, I found that using MSE loss for both the content and style yielded the best results. Furthermore, for the style calculation, I normalized the gram matrix by dividing by the number of elements in it before it is passed into MSE.
                When using the loss functions (SSD) and without Gram matrix normalization (as outlined in the paper), my total loss exploded upwards to the hundred thousands for many iterations and had difficulty converging to a small loss. 
                However, when using MSE for loss and gram matrix normalization, I was able to drive the loss down to less than 1 for all tests. 
                The loss seemed to converge around 500-600 epochs. Another notable difference is that I omitted weights applied to each style loss when computing the total loss, as it helped with the issue stated previously. 
                Finally, input normalization is not mentioned in the paper, however I found that adding a normalization layer as the first layer helped.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the way I obtained the losses from each layer, I added content and style loss modules after the RELU layer that succeeds each convolutional layer of interest in order to probe activation losses. 
                It is necessary to put the loss modules after the RELU layer for the gradients to match what was stated in the paper.
                The convolutional layers of interest in my implementation were conv1_1, conv2_1, conv3_1, conv4_1, and conv5_1. Additionally, I changed all max pool layers inside VGG19 to avg pool as the authors noted that avg pool seemed to work better.
                After each forward pass, I would calculate the appropriate loss using each module I added to VGG19. The optimizer I used was LBFGS.
                It is also worth mentioning that I froze the weights of VGG19 and put the model on eval mode while running gradient descent on the input image (as also mentioned in the paper).
            </p>

            <h2> Initial Results </h2>
            <p>For my initial results below, I used the following setup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input: Randomly Generated Image</li>
                <li>Content Loss Weight: 1</li>
                <li>Style Loss Weight: 1,000,000</li>
                <li>Content Layer: conv4_1</li>
                <li>Style Layers: conv1_1, conv2_1, conv3_1, conv4_1, and conv5_1</li>
                <li>Optimizer: LBFGS</li>
                <li>Epochs: 600</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Below are visualizations of the training process over 600 epochs. Each frame (aside from the first initial frame) is generated every 10 epochs.</p>

            <h2>Initial Results: Discussion</h2>
            <p>The style seems to be definitely transfering over, however the content and style do not mix very nicely together. 
                While the background of the content photos seem to adopt the style fairly decently, the subjects of the content images seem to struggle when it comes to mixing with the style. 
                The houses and animals adopt the style's color, however not the brush strokes of the style image.
                Furthermore, in Tuebingen Neckarfront's mixture with Composition VII, artifacts tend to randomly flicker for a few frames towards the end of the training process.
                Perhaps the complexity or chaoticness of the style image or the realism of the content image causes these random spikes in loss. The spikes in loss may be due to exploding gradients. Below are the loss graphs for each of the results above.
